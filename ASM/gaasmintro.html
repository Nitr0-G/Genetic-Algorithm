<h1>Genetic Algorithm with Floating Point at Assembler.</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this article is introduce how to make Genetic Algorithm @asm ,
and how to make assembly program, and my Enhglish skill up.
I don't have good ENGLISH and enough knowledge about GA and FP.
By writing this article , I'll teach  about GA ,FP , and ENGLISH  to me .
If you read this , soonly you notice that I like to use "don't know" .
When I use the words, I really don't know (hmm this is first time , you see).
If you know about it plz teach it to me ,and I want to fix it

When I started writing this article , I was going to make the series of lesson.
But during writing , this article became one article by itself .
So something strange is appeared in place .
If you have enough time and enough perseverance , I want you to read through the whole article at first.
And read again , then you can understand ... I hope so .

<h2>Compiler</h2>
I use NASM.

<h2>First</h2>

First program we make is only quit . Nothing is done .
But it's important how to know quit.
following code is ga001.asm:

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- ga001.asm ---
	org 0100h
start:
<font color=darkgreen>; quit program.</font>
	ret
--- ga001.asm ---
</font>
</pre>

Line 1 is declaration that this program start at 0100h .<br>
Line 2 is the label, if you want to back to start, you can use this label.<br>
Line 3 is comment . At nasm ';' is comment start and anything after this is ignored.<br>
Line 4 is command which is only this program have. And this statement( command ) is<br>
quit the program (exactly it has described another expression... but now I use it for QUIT the program)<br>

<h3>Compile</h3>

Next How to compile it ?
<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- cut ---
nasm -f bin -o ga001.com ga001.asm
--- cut ---
</font>
</pre>

<h3>Run</h3>
How to use it?

Let's invoke
<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- magic word ---
ga001
--- magic word ---
</font>
</pre>

screen shot isn't avalable ... but something like this .
<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- screen mimic ---
C:\gaasm>nasm -f bin -o ga001.com ga001.asm

C:\gaasm>ga001

C:\gaasm>
--- mimic is dead ---
</font>
</pre>

umm , it works well ,but there's nothing... like JAPANESE Bank's rates of interest.

<h2>Before making GENE pool</h2>

We must construct the GENE pool and filled it random numbers.
Method of random number generating is alot of type.
It's heavy factor of GA , though I currently choose easy one which is work.
Of course you can prepare own fantastic random routine.
To randomize I use following interupt( DOS only ):

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- from Ralf's interupt list ---
AH = 00h

Return:
CX:DX = number of clock ticks since midnight
AL = midnight flag, nonzero if midnight passed since time last read
--- from Ralf's interupt list ---
</font>
</pre>

How to invoke .

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- randomize ---
<font color=darkgreen>;randomize   initialize rand seed</font>
	xor ah,ah		<font color=darkgreen>; ah = 0</font>
	int 1Ah			<font color=darkgreen>; get date and time</font>
--- randomize ---
</font>
</pre>

umm , Why 'xor ah,ah' makes ah = 0 ? 'XOR' is exclusive OR .

<pre>
---XOR----
A | B | R
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 1
1 | 1 | 0
---XOR----
</pre>

As you see , if A and B is same ( A is set and B is set or , both is unset )
Result is 0 . and if A and B isn't same , Result = 1.
If we take ah as A , and ah as B , all bit is same . so ah = 0.

Feed seed

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- feed seed ---
<font color=darkgreen>; dx is wide range</font>
<font color=darkgreen>; cx is small...?</font>
<font color=darkgreen>; so we take cx as 1st seed and dx as 2nd seed</font>
	mov [seed1],cx		<font color=darkgreen>; save seed1</font>
	mov [seed2],dx		<font color=darkgreen>; save seed2</font>
--- feed seed ---
</font>
</pre>

Now Random generating routine have gotten two seeds.
I made following routine , I don't know it work pretty well.
But as far as I dumped , It seem to work enough well and pretty complex to explain it...
So I don't explain it :) , plz Don't complain for my lazy ...

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- random generate ---
<font color=darkgreen>; generate random number</font>
<font color=darkgreen>;  return</font>
<font color=darkgreen>;	ax = number</font>
random:
	db 0b8h	<font color=darkgreen>; mov ax,seed1</font>
seed1:	db 0,0

	dec ax	<font color=darkgreen>; decrement</font>
	
randloop:
	db 35h	<font color=darkgreen>; xor ax,seed2</font>
seed2:	db 0,0
	inc ax	<font color=darkgreen>;</font>
	xchg ah,al
	xor [seed2],ax	<font color=darkgreen>; 0.092</font>
	sub ax,[seed1]
	rol al,1	<font color=darkgreen>; 0.091</font>
	xchg ah,al	<font color=darkgreen>; 0.092</font>
	sub [seed1],ax	<font color=darkgreen>; change seed1</font>
	ret
--- random generate ---
</font>
</pre>

ver 0.091, I fix 'rol al,1' to 'ror al,1' , it works better ??
ver 0.092, 'xchg ah,al' before 'sub [seed1],ax' . 'xor [seed2],ax' before 'sub ax,[seed1]

Hi ppl , now we can generate any random number ( I hope so ...)
Finally , we stand the START line.
Let's make GENE POOL !!

But,,, before make GENE POOL . we have something to decide .
Because what kind of gene expression we use is important.
And it's depend on PROBLEM which we solve.
Umm , making problem is harder than solve it :) ,Joke .
I make 1 problem . It's a find the minimum value of fuction which
has some Sin/Cos functions . I want to choose easy one .
Everyone can understand where is the minimum , and if the funciton
have LOCAL minimum is better .
Exactly I don't have any idea of function's shape . So it's come back later.
But I decide the range of search space between to 0 to 1 .
I make start line , only we need is the whistle ( NOT **'s whistler :-) 

<h2>To make GENE POOL</h2>

First we decide the number of population. ( hmm , there is another problem )
I don't know how range I can use ...
So I gather 100 population for our system.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- something from 004 ---
POPULATION equ 100	<font color=darkgreen>; population of pool</font>
--- end of c&p ---
</font>
</pre>

This line is the population . If you want change population ,
you can take any number .( I don't know where is limit ...)

We decide the number of population. We make the pool with GENEs.
Following code is pool maker .

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- this is pool maker ---
	mov cx,POPULATION * 4	<font color=darkgreen>; why multiply by 4 ? A gene have 4 byte (32 bit)!</font>
	mov di,randnum
loop1:
	call random		<font color=darkgreen>; generate random number</font>
	stosb			<font color=darkgreen>; we store the number which we generate to [di]</font>
	loop loop1
--- this is pool maker ---
</font>
</pre>

cx is which time we loop(s).
stosb is value of AL into address which is indicated by di.
Now we have made the pool full of GENEs.

<h2>Evaluate</h2>

How do we evaluate it ?

hmm I copied this from test functions

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- here's function ---
Rosenbrock's Saddle

F(x) = Sum(i=1,n) { 100*(x_(i+1)-x_i^2)^2 + (1-x_i)^2 } 

-2.048 .le. x_i .le. 2.048 

Minimum = 0.0 at x_i=1.0
This function has a long curved valley which is only slightly decreasing.
--- here's function ---
</font>
</pre>

I decide when i = n , (i+1) = ( i + 1 ) mod i ,(ie . result 1 ).
And n = 2.So if I write 'y' , 'y' means 'x+1' .
So fomula is following

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- extract function ---
F(x) = Sum(i=1,n) { 100*(x_(i+1)-x_i^2)^2 + (1-x_i)^2 } 
     = { 100 * ( y - x ^ 2 ) ^ 2 + ( 1 - x ) ^ 2 } 
     + { 100 * ( x - y ^ 2 ) ^ 2 + ( 1 - y ) ^ 2 }
--- extract function ---
</font>
</pre>

First we have x and y  between -2.408 to 2.048
How do we implement this limitation ?
Remeber the remainder . If we divide the number by 4 and take the remainder of this , we get the number
which range is between 0 to 3.
So  we have divide the number , which gene express , by 4096( 2048*2 ).
following code is :

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- set up x ---
<font color=darkgreen>; setup x between -2048 to 2048</font>
	fild dword [ range ]	<font color=darkgreen>; store denominator (4096 , we need between 0 to 4096 )</font>
	fild dword [ di ]	<font color=darkgreen>; get gene for x</font>
	fabs			<font color=darkgreen>; absolute 'ST0'</font>
	fprem			<font color=darkgreen>; 0 < 'ST0' < 4096</font>
	fild dword [ rangef ]	<font color=darkgreen>; st0 = 2048 , st1 = 0 < x < 4096</font>
	fsubp st1,st0		<font color=darkgreen>; -2048 < 'ST0' < 2048</font>
<font color=darkgreen>; setup x between -2.048 to 2.048</font>
	fidiv word [ para2 ]
--- set up x ---
</font>
</pre>

do the same , make y .

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- set up y ( x + 1 ) ---
<font color=darkgreen>; setup y between -2048 to 2048</font>
	fild dword [ range ]	<font color=darkgreen>; store denominator (4096 , we need between 0 to 4096 )</font>
	fild dword [ di + 4 ]	<font color=darkgreen>; get gene for y</font>
	fabs			<font color=darkgreen>; absolute 'ST0'</font>
	fprem			<font color=darkgreen>; 0 < 'ST0' < 4096</font>
	fild dword [ rangef ]	<font color=darkgreen>; st0 = 2048 , st1 = 0 < y < 4096</font>
	fsubp st1,st0		<font color=darkgreen>; -2048 < 'ST0' < 2048</font>
<font color=darkgreen>; setup y between -2.048 to 2.048</font>
	fidiv word [ para2 ]
--- set up y ---
</font>
</pre>

Currently we have 4096 in two stacks . and we don't need them . so pop them.

Oops I did it again ...
We load integer value and divide by integer ,so we get remainder as integer value.
So we only have 4096 diffent value...
It's too narrow . I solve this problem with division 1000000.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>Following code is revised
--- division ---
	fabs			<font color=darkgreen>; absolute 'ST0'</font>
	fdiv dword [ million ]	<font color=darkgreen>; ver 0.094</font>
	fprem			<font color=darkgreen>; 0 < 'ST0' < 4096</font>
--- division ---
</font>
</pre>

Of course , we do this both x and y .
I notice that problem is between 'dd 1000000.0' and 'dd 1000000'.
for example:
<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- datas ---
million:  dd 1000000.0
million2: dd 1000000
--- datas ---
</font>
</pre>

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- code ---
	fld dword [ million ]
	fld dword [ million2 ]
--- code ---
</font>
</pre>

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- result ---
st0=+1.401298E-0039 st1=+1.000000E+0006
--- result ---
</font>
</pre>

hmm, I think these aren't same value...
If you make something floating point value , I suggest you ( of course me ) to
pay attention to this .

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- pop ---
<font color=darkgreen>; pop two 4096(s)</font>
	fxch st0,st3		<font color=darkgreen>; st0 ,st1 = 4096</font>
	fcompp			<font color=darkgreen>; pop st0,st1</font>
--- pop ---
</font>
</pre>

next we calculate "x_i^2"

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- calculate perm 1 ---
<font color=darkgreen>; we have st0 = x , st1 = y</font>
<font color=darkgreen>; load x</font>
	fld st0
<font color=darkgreen>; x^2</font>
	fmul st0		<font color=darkgreen>; x^2</font>
--- calculate perm 1 ---
</font>
</pre>


<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- calculate 2 ---
<font color=darkgreen>; load y</font>
	fld st2
<font color=darkgreen>; y - x_i^2</font>
	fsubrp st1
--- calculate 2 ---
</font>
</pre>

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- calculate 3 ---
<font color=darkgreen>;( y - x ^ 2 ) ^ 2</font>
	fmul st0
<font color=darkgreen>;100 * ( y - x ^ 2 ) ^ 2</font>
	fimul word [ para1 ]
--- calculate 3 ---
</font>
</pre>

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- calculate 4 ---
<font color=darkgreen>; 1 - x</font>
	fld1
	fsub st2
<font color=darkgreen>; ( 1 - x ) ^ 2</font>
	fmul st0
--- calculate 4 ---
</font>
</pre>

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- calculate 5 ---
<font color=darkgreen>;{ 100 * ( y - x ^ 2 ) ^ 2 + ( 1 - x ) ^ 2 } </font>
	faddp st1
--- calculate 5 ---
</font>
</pre>

Do the same manner , when we calculate '{ 100 * ( x - y ^ 2 ) ^ 2 + ( 1 - y ) ^ 2 }'

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>Code is following ,but I don't explain it anymore.
--- calculate 6 ---
<font color=darkgreen>; load y</font>
	fld st2
<font color=darkgreen>; y^2</font>
	fmul st0		<font color=darkgreen>; y_i^2</font>
<font color=darkgreen>; load x</font>
	fld st2
<font color=darkgreen>; x - y^2</font>
	fsubrp st1
<font color=darkgreen>;( y - x ^ 2 ) ^ 2</font>
	fmul st0
<font color=darkgreen>;100 * ( y - x ^ 2 ) ^ 2</font>
	fimul word [ para1 ]
<font color=darkgreen>; 1 - x</font>
	fld1
	fsub st3
<font color=darkgreen>; ( 1 - x ) ^ 2</font>
	fmul st0
<font color=darkgreen>;{ 100 * ( y - x ^ 2 ) ^ 2 + ( 1 - x ) ^ 2 } </font>
	faddp st1
--- calculate 6 ---
</font>
</pre>


<pre>
<font color=darkblue>So we finish calculating perms . Finally , we add them . And store it to [si].
--- sum up & store ---
<font color=darkgreen>; store fitness to [si]</font>
	fstp dword [si]
--- sum up & store ---
</font>
</pre>

When we have stored the fitness value. But we have 2 value in FP stack .
So we pop them ,and return .

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- finalize ---
	fcompp
	ret 
--- finalize ---
</font>
</pre>

<h2>Selection</h2>

Hey , fitness value is finished . We must select the adam and eve with fitness value.
( hmm if they didn't eat apple , they must not select with fitness :)
We shoot she and he with roulette .

<h3>Roulette Selection Algorithm.</h3>

Before start this section.I change little bit ,but it's important.
By now , I used the size of gene with 4 , it's constant . This isn't good .
When we change the genesize , all 4 turn to new size in source code.
So I make it CONSTANT .

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- gene size ---
GENESIZE equ 4
--- gene size ---
</font>
</pre>

If you want to change size of gene, only change this line.
All line will be affected , WHEN you RECOMPILE it .
( it's often occured for me, source is updated , but execute isn't updated ... )

Let's get back to the feature !
I choose the roulette selection . But there are various selection algo.
I don't know why I choose it :) . But I choose it .
Tactics is following
<blockquote>
	<ol>
	<li>sum up the all fitness ( total )
	<li>make random number between 0 to total.
	<li>compare one's fitness and total
	<li>if one's fitness is less than total , total = total - fitness and goto 3
	<li>copy this indivisual to parent1
	<li>do the same 3 - 5 to make parent2
	</ol>
</blockquote>

umm But , much of debuggind time brought me some fatal bug...
If following routine is made , great value is occupied wide range seat.
Luckily , I found solution. To take  a reciprocal number .
And always before calculatition , we take a reciprocal number .
No other change is needed . 
But this leave us big problem ,if we choose this solution forever,
we always must change this routine.
In future ( isn't so long ) , I'll standardize it to something.

This is flow of my routine. Seeing is believing.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- roulette selection initialize ---
selection:
<font color=darkgreen>; Roulette selection</font>
<font color=darkgreen>; initialize</font>
	fldz			<font color=darkgreen>; total</font>
	mov di,fitness		<font color=darkgreen>; start address of fitness value</font>
	mov cx,POPULATION	<font color=darkgreen>; number of POPULATION</font>
--- roulette selection initialize ---
</font>
</pre>

umm , initializing routine is quite quiet.
'fldz' loads 0 to st(0) .

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- roulette selection 1 ---
<font color=darkgreen>; calculation total fitness</font>
rouletteloop1:
	fld1			<font color=darkgreen>; 0.092</font>
	fld dword [di]		<font color=darkgreen>; load fitness</font>
	fdivp st1		<font color=darkgreen>; 0.092</font>
	faddp st1		<font color=darkgreen>; sum up fitness</font>
	add di,4		<font color=darkgreen>; to point next fitness</font>
	loop rouletteloop1
--- roulette selection 1 ---
</font>
</pre>

2 line have its comment with '0.092' . This is fixed version to calculate a reciprocal.<br>
This loop is looped by POPULATION times.And when loop is finished , st0 have total.<br>
So I explain about 'fld1' , 'fld dword [di]' , 'fdivp st1' , and 'faddp st1'. <br>
Before we start this , we initialized FPU STACK with 'fldz'.So st(0) = 0.0 (after 'fldz')<br>

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- stack ---
before 'fld1'           - st(0) = 0
'fld1'                  - st(0) = 1 , st(1) = 0
'fld dword [di]'        - st(0) = gene(0)'s fitness value , st(1) = 1 ,st(2) = 0
'fdivp st1'             - st(0) = a reciprocal of gene(0)'s fitness   ,st(1) = 0
'faddp st1'             - st(0) = a reciprocal of gene(0)'s fitness
--- stack ---
</font>
</pre>

st(0) 's value ( this time was 0 ) push to st(1) , and st(0) have gene(0)'s fitness value , indicated by [di] .<br>
<p>
Next 'faddp st1' is done .<br>
st(1) = st(1) + st(0) , and pop st(0) , so st(1) have nothing , st(0) have fitness value.<br>
<p>
Then di = di + 4 , so [di] indicates next genes fitness value.And loop .<br>
When loop ends , st(0) have total fitness .<br>

Next we make random number between 0 to total.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- roulette selecion 2 ---
<font color=darkgreen>; roulette start</font>
	call random		<font color=darkgreen>; generate random</font>
	mov [ randtmp ] , ax	<font color=darkgreen>; save random to temp</font>
	fild dword [ randtmp ]	<font color=darkgreen>; load random number from temp</font>
	fild dword [ randmax ]	<font color=darkgreen>; load maximum number of random</font>
	fdivp st1		<font color=darkgreen>; st1 / st0 ( random / maximum ), this make 0 < random < 1</font>
	fmul st1		<font color=darkgreen>; 0 < target < total fitness</font>
--- roulette selecion 2 ---
</font>
</pre>

this formula is all : target = ( random number / maximum random number ) * total<br>
By doing this ,we know where is target .So we can choose adam.<br>

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- FPU STACK is something like ... ---
call random		- st(0) = total fitness
mov [ randtmp ] , ax	- st(0) = total fitness
fild dword [ randtmp ]	- st(0) = random number , st(1) = total fitness
fild dword [ randmax ]	- st(0) = RANDOM MAX    , st(1) = random number , st(2) = total fitness
fdivp st1		- st(0) = 0 < random < 1, st(1) = total fitness
fmul st1		- st(0) = 0 < random < total fitness , st(1) = total fitness
--- FPU STACK is something like ... ---
</font>
</pre>

Next we have some initialization.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>

	mov cx,POPULATION	<font color=darkgreen>; number of POPULATION</font>

	mov di,fitness - 4		<font color=darkgreen>; start address of fitness value - 4 ( 1 previous )</font>
--- roulette selection before3 ---
</font>
</pre>

Why [ - GENESIZE ] ? Why [ - 4 ] ? We compare the chanpion ( current minimum ) and target ( canditate ) .
At first Following code will do , add GENESIZE or 4 . To do this , next indivisual is target canditate.
So if we set " randnum " only , the first indivisual isn't investigated .

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- roulette selection 3 - 4 ---

	add si, GENESIZE	<font color=darkgreen>; next gene</font>
	add di,4		<font color=darkgreen>; next fitness</font>

--- roulette selection 3 - 4 ---
</font>
</pre>

Firstly, increment canditate. and calculate a reciprocal of its fitness( fld1 ... fdivp ).<br>
And compare with total (fcom st1 ).<br>
Next line 'fnstsw ax' is tricky . This is load FPU STATUS into 'AX' .<br>
As comment say , we only need 1 flag ( of FPU STATUS ) , which is at  bit 0 of ah.<br>
After loading FPU STATUS into AX , we check  bit 0 of ah .<br>
With "and ah,1"<br>
If bit 0 of ah is clear(0) , zero flag is clear .<br>
If bit 0 of ah is   set(1) , zero flag is set.<br>
Next (fsubp ...) is total = total - fitness . By doing this ,total down to 0 .<br>
And if total is enough small , someone's fitness is grater than total.He is ADAM :)<br>
<p>
We met adam , so we want him to meet eve under the apple tree .
So we pick up him from pool ( he can't swim well )

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- roulette selection 5 ---
<font color=darkgreen>; now [ si ] is adam's gene</font>
	mov di, parent1		<font color=darkgreen>; here's seat for him</font>
	mov cx, GENESIZE	<font color=darkgreen>; to copy gene , cx have genesize (byte)</font>
	rep movsb		<font color=darkgreen>; do copy</font>
	fcomp	st1		<font color=darkgreen>; adios adam</font>
--- roulette selection 5 ---
</font>
</pre>

We copy GENESIZE ( bytes) . 
'rep movsb' do:
[ di ] = [ si ].  di = di + 1 , si = si + 1.
(exactlly di and si is affected flag...but now I don't explain it ) 

This is a half of way .But another half is same.
Only diffrence is before 'ret' isn't 'fcomp st1' .
The line before 'ret' is 'fcompp' ( 2 stack is poped )

Making offspring 

The main stream is 
	1. select parents
	2. crossover choosen parents
	3. go to 1 until next generation is full.
I don't want cx and di to destroy . So I use push and pop to save them.

The code will explain by itself :)

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- maker ---
<font color=darkgreen>; making offspring loop</font>
<font color=darkgreen>; init</font>
	mov cx, POPULATION	<font color=darkgreen>; loop counter for  next generation</font>
	mov di, offspring	<font color=darkgreen>; next swimmers warming up room</font>
makeoffspring:
	push cx
	push di
	call selection		<font color=darkgreen>; selecti parents by ROULETTe alGo</font>
	pop di
	call crossover		<font color=darkgreen>; corssover by uniform crossover</font>
	add di, GENESIZE	<font color=darkgreen>; next position</font>
	pop cx
	loop makeoffspring

Where is 'crossover' ? , Next !

Crossover

We have choosen both parents ( sometimes parent... )

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- crossover ---
<font color=darkgreen>; uniform crossover</font>
<font color=darkgreen>;   parent1, parent2 is gene</font>
<font color=darkgreen>;   di = offsprring ( destination address )</font>
<font color=darkgreen>; broken:</font>
<font color=darkgreen>;	ax,bx,cx,dx</font>
--- crossover ---
</font>
</pre>

umm, These are comments .

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- crossover 1 ---
crossover:
        xor bx,bx			<font color=darkgreen>; indicator ( counter ) reset</font>
--- crossover 1 ---
</font>
</pre>

bx is used for indicator which we are treating and also store the offspring.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- crossover 1.5 ---
crossover0:
	mov cx,8			<font color=darkgreen>;1 byte is 8 bit.</font>
--- crossover 1.5 ---
</font>
</pre>

Why cx is 8 ? caz 1 byte is 8 bits. So we can loop whole a byte.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- crossover 2 ---
crossover1:
        call random			<font color=darkgreen>; generate random number</font>
        shr al,1			<font color=darkgreen>; check even or odd</font>
        jc crossover2			<font color=darkgreen>; if odd (ie carry flag is set ) , take parent2</font>
        mov al , [ parent1 + bx ]	<font color=darkgreen>; because even , take parent1</font>
        jmp crossover3			<font color=darkgreen>; go to set</font>
crossover2:
        mov al , [ parent2 + bx ]	<font color=darkgreen>; take parent2</font>
crossover3:
--- crossover 2 ---
</font>
</pre>

First call random , and check the number is odd or even.
The probability is half and half . If odd we take parent2 , so jump.
If even , we take parent1 .And pass through parent2 routine.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- crossover 3 ---
	shl al,cl			<font color=darkgreen>; shift al left by cl times</font>
	rcr dl,1			<font color=darkgreen>; rotate dl including carry flag by 1</font>
--- crossover 3 ---
</font>
</pre>

This is something tricky for non-assembler experience users.
First shift al ( which have parent we choose ) left cl times .
So al's ( 8 - cx ) bit go to carry flag.
Second rotate dl 1 times to right, according to this dl's 7 bit is same carry flag.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- crossover 4 ---
	loop crossover1			<font color=darkgreen>; cx = cx -1</font>
--- crossover 4 ---
</font>
</pre>

these pattern is repeated 8 times ( 1 byte is 8 bit )

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- crossover 5 ---
	mov [di + bx],dl		<font color=darkgreen>; save it as gene</font>
        inc bx
        cmp bx , GENESIZE
        jnz crossover0
--- crossover 5 ---
</font>
</pre>

After looping , we have made 1 byte . So we store it as offspring's gene.
And counter is increased . If counter( this case 'bx' ) isn't GENESIZE, loop back to crossover0.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- crossover 6 ---
	ret
--- crossover 6 ---
</font>
</pre>

bye bye crossover routine ...

Mutation

Firstly we decide how often mutation occurs . I take 0.001 for this.
I think it's good that rate is between 0 to 1 ( 0 =< rate =< 1 )

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- mutationrate ---
mutationrate:	dd 0.001	<font color=darkgreen>; mutation rate</font>
--- mutationrate ---
</font>
</pre>

Secondly , we initialize for mutation routine.
Almost of initialization routine is as same as crossover.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- mutation initialize ---
<font color=darkgreen>; mutation</font>
<font color=darkgreen>; di = offspring start address</font>
mutation:
        xor bx,bx
mutation0:
        mov cx,8                <font color=darkgreen>;1 byte is 8 bit.</font>
--- mutation initialize ---
</font>
</pre>

Next, we want rancom number between 0 to 1 .
Remember we made this routine before.So copy and paste.
And modify it for this routine.
And to compare , we must load mutationrate .

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- mutation 1 ---
	call random		<font color=darkgreen>; generate random</font>
	mov [ randtmp ] , ax	<font color=darkgreen>; save temp</font>
	fld dword[ mutationrate ]	<font color=darkgreen>; load mutationrate</font>
	fild dword [ randtmp ]	<font color=darkgreen>; load random number from temp</font>
	fild dword [ randmax ]	<font color=darkgreen>; load maximum number of random</font>
	fdivp st1		<font color=darkgreen>; st1 / st0 , this make 0 < random < 1</font>
--- mutation 1 ---
</font>
</pre>

Next we compare mutationrate and random number.
If mutationrate > random number then mutation occur.
If mutationrate < random number then mutation does not occur.
well if mutationrate = random number ? , hehe homework :)

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- stack ---
fld dword[ mutationrate ]	- st(0) = mutation rate
fild dword [ randtmp ]		- st(0) = random number , st(1) = mutation rate
fild dword [ randmax ]		- st(0) = RAND_MAX , st(1) = random number st(2) = mutation rate
fdivp st1			- st(0) = random number / RNAD_MAX , st(1) = mutaion rate
--- stack ---
</font>
</pre>

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- mutation 2 ---
	fcompp			<font color=darkgreen>; compare and pop st0 ,st1</font>
	fnstsw ax		<font color=darkgreen>; during st0 < st1 ,ah = ???????1 . if st0 > st1 ah = ???????0</font>
	shr ah,1		<font color=darkgreen>; bit 0 of ah -> carry flag</font>
	rcr dl,1		<font color=darkgreen>; save carry flag</font>
        loop mutation1		<font color=darkgreen>; do this 1 byte( ie 8 times )</font>
--- mutation 2 ---
</font>
</pre>

Flag condtion is at ah's bit 0. So we did 'shr ah,1' , carry flag have condition.
And 'rcr dl' , 'dl' have condtion .
If there is mutaion , 'dl' have '1' on that bit.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- mutation 3 ---
        xor [ di + bx ] , dl	<font color=darkgreen>; Do MUTATION</font>
--- mutation 3 ---
</font>
</pre>

So we know where is mutation when we investigate with 'dl'.
'xor' make the mutation .

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- mutation 4 ---
        inc bx			<font color=darkgreen>; next position</font>
        cmp bx,GENESIZE		<font color=darkgreen>; it's end?</font>
        jnz mutation0		<font color=darkgreen>; if it's not end , we go back to 'mutation0'.</font>
--- mutation 4 ---
</font>
</pre>

Do these routines until whole gene.

MainLoop

Finally , we make all element of GA .So We make main loop .
The main loop is most important factor which is when GA is end .
But this time , I decide to loop 10000 times , if the best optimal solution is found.
Of course , you can implement the main loop is end when the best solution is found.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- mainloop 1 ---
<font color=darkgreen>; mainloop start</font>
        mov cx, 10000   <font color=darkgreen>; main loop counter</font>
mainloop:
        push cx         <font color=darkgreen>; save main loop counter </font>
--- mainloop 1 ---
</font>
</pre>

Why 'push cx' ? , caz 'cx' might be destroy during loop.So we save it.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- mainloop 2 ---
<font color=darkgreen>; calculate all fitness</font>
        mov cx, POPULATION
        mov di , randnum
        mov si , fitness
loop2:
        call evaluate
        add di, GENESIZE        <font color=darkgreen>; ver 0.06</font>
        add si,4
        loop loop2
--- mainloop 2 ---
</font>
</pre>

Each gene's fitness is calculated and stored.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- mainloop 3 ---
<font color=darkgreen>; making offspring loop</font>
<font color=darkgreen>; init</font>
        mov cx, POPULATION      <font color=darkgreen>; loop counter for  next generation</font>
        mov di, offspring       <font color=darkgreen>; next swimmer warming up room</font>
makeoffspring:
        push cx
        push di
        call selection          <font color=darkgreen>; selection by ROULETTe alGo</font>
        pop di
        call crossover          <font color=darkgreen>; corssover by uniform crossover</font>
        call mutation           <font color=darkgreen>; mutation</font>
        add di, GENESIZE        <font color=darkgreen>; next offspring's position</font>
        pop cx
        loop makeoffspring
--- mainloop 3 ---
</font>
</pre>

Make next generation.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- mainloop 4 ---
<font color=darkgreen>; judgement gene reach to goal ?</font>
        pop cx			<font color=darkgreen>; load loop counter</font>
        push cx			<font color=darkgreen>; save again</font>
        cmp cx,1		<font color=darkgreen>; if the loop is end this time</font>
        jnz changepool  	<font color=darkgreen>; if the loop is continued , go to next.</font>
        call judgement		<font color=darkgreen>; search best fitness</font>
--- mainloop 4 ---
</font>
</pre>

Once we load counter and check it if this time is end .
Umm , this is dirty way... But now , I remain it.
If loop is continued , we go to next .
If loop is end this time , we search best fitness.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- mainloop 5 ---
<font color=darkgreen>; change gene to new.</font>
changepool:
        mov di, randnum			<font color=darkgreen>; old gene pool</font>
        mov si, offspring		<font color=darkgreen>; new gene are here.</font>
        mov cx, POPULATION * GENESIZE	<font color=darkgreen>; size of pool</font>
        rep movsb			<font color=darkgreen>; Do change</font>
--- mainloop 5 ---
</font>
</pre>

We have made new gene pool , and change old pool with new one.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- mainloop 6 ---
        pop cx			<font color=darkgreen>; counter is back</font>
        loop mainlooop		<font color=darkgreen>; loop</font>
--- mainloop 6 ---
</font>
</pre>

This is the entire mainloop routine.
But where is 'judgement' routine ? Follow me !

Judgement

These code is used for judgement.
Usually , judgement routine check whether any solution satisfies end condition .
But this doesn't check it. Only search minimum solution .

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- judgement initialize ---
<font color=darkgreen>; judgement</font>
<font color=darkgreen>;  this version is to search minimum value of fitness.</font>
<font color=darkgreen>;  return </font>
<font color=darkgreen>;       si = best gene address</font>
<font color=darkgreen>;       dx = best fitness value address</font>
judgement:
        mov bx, randnum			<font color=darkgreen>; bx = start address of gene</font>
        mov si,bx			<font color=darkgreen>; si = bx</font>
        mov di , fitness		<font color=darkgreen>; dx = start address of fitness value</font>
        mov dx,di			<font color=darkgreen>; di = dx</font>
        mov cx , POPULATION - 1		<font color=darkgreen>; cx is loop counter</font>
        fld dword [ di ]		<font color=darkgreen>; first fitness is loaded</font>
--- judgement initialize ---
</font>
</pre>

Above section is initialized routine.

<pre>
<font color=darkblue>
--- judgement 1 ---
judgement1:
        add bx, GENESIZE                <font color=darkgreen>; next gene</font>
        add di, 4                       <font color=darkgreen>; next fitness</font>
        fld dword [ di ]                <font color=darkgreen>; load fitness value</font>
        fcom st1                        <font color=darkgreen>; compare st0( current ) and st1 ( minimum )</font>
        fnstsw ax			<font color=darkgreen>; st0 < st1 ,ah = ???????1 . st0 > st1 ah = ???????0</font>
        shr ah,1			<font color=darkgreen>; check ah</font>
        jnc judgement2
        mov dx,di                       <font color=darkgreen>; save address of fitness value</font>
        mov si,bx                       <font color=darkgreen>; save address of gene</font>
        fxch st0,st1			<font color=darkgreen>; exchange minimum value</font>
judgement2:
        fcomp st1			<font color=darkgreen>; poped</font>
        loop judgement1
        fcomp st1			<font color=darkgreen>; poped</font>
        ret
--- judgement 1 ---

</font>
</pre>
<p>
Tactics is following
<blockquote>
	<ol>
	<li>we have the front gene's fitness value and gene address .
	<li>compare it to next gene's fitness and if next is smaller( higher ) than it<br>
	   we have smaller (higher) one's fitness and gene address.
	<li>go to 1.
	</ol>
</blockquote>
This is all.

<h2>Conclusion?</h2>

For the present, we could make GA system.But there are many of possibility . 
Something , single point mutation , elitism , island model etc...
If you have something interesting , I'm glad.

<h1>Future Plan</h1>
<i> ( Now there is alot of hope for optimization)</i>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
	<li>Make Smaller if only 1 byte and Speed up if can .
	<li>Some problem in this article revealed will be fixed.
	<li>I want this code run under pmode or something like that... to have wide range memory
	<li>And I want to have SCRIPT LANGUAGE .
	<li>Export to another platform . 
	</ul>
</blockquote>
Let's enjoy coding!
